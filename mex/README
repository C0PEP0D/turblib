JHU Turbulence Database Cluster
Matlab Interface Library
http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/

**** About this package ****

This library provides a very simple wrapper around gSOAP for
calling the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster.

More information can be found at:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/matlab/

Users should first check that the Makefile variables are
specified to reflect system settings. The MEX variable should
point to the 'mex' executable located in same directory as the
'matlab' executable. This can be accomplished by either 
specifying the absolute path or setting the PATH environment
variable appropriately. 

NOTE: Users can adjust the MEX variable in the Makefile to build
for GNU Octave if Matlab is not installed.

Runing 'make' will build the Matlab MEX functions which are 
called directly from Matlab. The file turbm.m is a sample 
M-file that demonstrates how to call the database functions.

**** Identification Token (optional, for now) ****

While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep
track of who is using the service, and how.  To this end,
we would like each user or site to obtain an authorization
token from us:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/authtoken.html

If you are just experimenting, the default token included
in these test files should be valid.

**** Mac OS X Notes ****

You will need the Apple Developer Tools (Xcode), which
can be found on your OS X install disk, or downloaded
for free (with registration) from
   http://developer.apple.com/

**** Linux Notes ****

Most versions of gcc should work.  

**** Other Platforms ****

Not tested.  Pleae let us know if any changes are needed.
