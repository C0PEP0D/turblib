JHU Turbulence Database Cluster
Fortran, C and Matlab Interface Library
http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/

**** About this package ****

This library provides a very simple wrapper around gSOAP for
calling the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster.

More information can be found at:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/c-fortran/

'make' will build both the Fortran and C sample code.
Use 'make turbc' if you do not have a Fortran compiler
installed.

The Matlab interface is under the mex/ directory.
Please see mex/README for instructions.

**** Identification Token (required for large queries) ****

While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep
track of who is using the service, and how.  To this end,
we would like each user or site to obtain an authorization
token from us:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/authtoken.html

If you are just experimenting, the default token included
in these test files should be valid.

**** Handling intermittent failures ****

We suggest writing code to handle any intermittent network
or database failures which may occur.  The following
sample code will try each query up to 25 times, with a delay
of 1 minute between each attempt.

int attempts = 0;
while (getVelocity ( ... ) != SOAP_OK) {
  if (attempts++ > 25) {
    printf("Fatal error: too many failures\n");
    exit(1);
  } else {
    printf("Temporary Error: %s\n", turblibGetErrorString());
  }
  sleep(60);
}

**** Mac OS X Notes ****

This code has been run under Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger),
10.5 (Leopard) and 10.6 (Snow Leopard).

You will need the Apple Developer Tools (Xcode), which
can be found on your OS X install disk, or downloaded
for free (with registration) from
   http://developer.apple.com/

If you wish to use fortran, you will need to install
gfortran.  We have been using the precompiled versions
available from
  http://hpc.sourceforge.net/

**** Linux Notes ****

Most gcc releases should work.  If you wish to use
fortran you will need to install gfortran, available as
an optional package with most Linux distributions.

**** Other Platforms ****

Please let us know if any changes are needed for the code
to compile on other platforms or with different compilers.
