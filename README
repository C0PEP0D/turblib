JHU Turbulence Database Cluster
Fortran & C Interface Library
http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/

**** About this package ****

This library provides a very simple wrapper around gSOAP for
calling the JHU Turbulence Database Cluster.

More information can be found at:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/c-fortran/

'make' will build both the Fortran and C sample code.
Use 'make turbc' if you do not have a Frotran compiler
installed.

**** Identification Token (optional, for now) ****

While our service is open to anyone, we would like to keep
track of who is using the service, and how.  To this end,
we would like each user or site to obtain an authorization
token from us:
  http://turbulence.pha.jhu.edu/help/authtoken.html

If you are just experimenting, the default token included
in these test files should be valid.

**** Mac OS X Notes ****

This code has been run under Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5.

You will need the Apple Developer Tools (Xcode), which
can be found on your OS X install disk, or downloaded
for free (with registration) from
   http://developer.apple.com/

If you wish to use fortran, you will need to install
gfortran.  We have been using the precompiled versions
available from
  http://hpc.sourceforge.net/


**** Linux Notes ****

Most versions of gcc should work.  If you wish to use fortran
you will need to install gfortran, available as an optional
package with most Linux distributions.

**** Other Platforms ****

Not tested.  Pleae let us know if any changes are needed.
We are aware that the code may not work with other Fotran
compilers.
